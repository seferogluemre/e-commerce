React Project: Basic E-Commerce Platform
This project is a simple, beginner-level e-commerce platform built with React. The app displays a list of products, allowing users to view detailed information for each product. From the product detail page, users can add items to their shopping cart and manage their cart easily.

Additionally, the platform allows users to add products to their favorites and remove them as needed. It focuses on key e-commerce features like product display, cart functionality, and the ability to manage favorites, all built with Reactâ€™s component-based structure.

This project serves as a great introduction to React and its state management, while offering a straightforward and engaging e-commerce experience.
